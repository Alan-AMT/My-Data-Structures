These are my own code implementations (using C and Python) of some data structures 

# About the code implementations
Each code implementation includes the main functionalities of the data structure. The main functionalities are divided into 3 different groups:
    "Builders"
    "Observers"
    "Destroyers".
    Some data structures may have an extra group called "Special" for specific structure-realted functionalities

NOTE: These code implementations are mainly based on books and courses but some of them have a "refactored" branch in which I coded them to be easier to use or code (using inheritance)
