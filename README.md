These are my own code implementations (using C and Python) of some data structures 

# About the code implementations
Each code implementation includes the main functionalities of the data structure. The main functionalities are divided into 3 different groups:
    "Builders"
    "Observers"
    "Destroyers".
    Some data structures may have an extra group called "Special" for specific structure-realted functionalities
